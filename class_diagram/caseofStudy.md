## Case of Study

The goal is to design a school course domain model. 

*So...*
- a Course has no more than 30 Students, where one of the Students is the “headman” of the Course. 
- The whole course learns the same subjects except for “foreign language” subject (some of the students learn English and other French). 
- A Teacher can teach from one to many subjects, but he just has one Course assigned.
- The Student can be evaluated by subject, so he will get a partial grade every 4 months, and a final grade at the end of the school year.
